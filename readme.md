Deep-Learning Neural Networks with Accord .NET
==============================================

A simple example of using the Accord .NET C# library to implement a deep-learning neural network (ie., Deep Belief Network) with machine learning.

Checkout tag "XOR" for a simple example of deep-learning with Accord .NET. This tag contains training using one of the most basic neural network cases - the XOR function.

Checkout the master branch for a slightly less-basic example of training on an ASCII digit dataset. This example uses multiple layers in the neural network and has the potential to "dream" representations of data within its layers.
